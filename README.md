# ATM-and-Banking-Sytsem
# Introduction:
This C++ program simulates an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system for National Bank, offering functionalities such as account creation, balance inquiries, cash withdrawals, deposits, and account deletion. The program utilizes file handling to store account information securely. Users interact with the ATM by entering their CNIC (Computerized National Identity Card), setting up a PIN for security, and performing transactions based on their account balance. The interface uses console text coloring and simple prompts to guide users through account operations. The program ensures security measures by validating inputs, such as verifying the correct format of the CNIC and ensuring the PIN matches before granting access to account functionalities. It handles exceptions, such as suspending access after multiple incorrect PIN attempts, and offers options for account deletion upon user request.
# Summary:
This C++ project begins by prompting users to enter their CNIC to access their account or create a new one if it doesn't exist. Users can create an account by providing their CNIC, full name, and a 4-digit PIN for security. Account information is stored in separate files named after the CNIC, name, and PIN. Upon successful login using the PIN, users can perform transactions like cash withdrawals, deposits, check their balance, or delete their account. The program updates account balances in real-time after each transaction and provides feedback to the user accordingly. The project demonstrates key concepts of file handling, conditional statements, loops, and function usage in C++, providing a practical example of an ATM system tailored for a fictional National Bank.
